## Go-Skynet Common Interfaces
This package is intended to be consumed by the go-* series of local AI backends used by the go-skynet project.

This package exists to contain shared structures and functions that are common to all backends. Code specific to actually instantiating or leveraging these types likely belongs in a more specific project.
